            <h1 class="centered"><b>Salesforce Hackathon Experience</b></h1><hr/>
            <p>I participated in a CRM infra hackathon with a team of two software engineers. Our goal was to build a tool that could analyze Java heap dumps and make it easier for developers to identify memory leaks in their application and identify the teams responsible for the leaks.
                The hackathon lasted for 72 hours and we had to work non-stop to complete our project on time. We divided the work amongst ourselves and got to work right away. I was responsible for the backend logic, while my team members worked on the front-end and data processing.
                The first few hours were spent on researching and brainstorming ideas. We had to make sure our solution was unique and could solve a real-world problem. We also had to make sure that it was feasible within the time constraint.
                As the days went on, we encountered several challenges and roadblocks. We had to pivot our approach a few times, but we didn't give up. We were determined to deliver a working prototype by the end of the hackathon.
                Finally, after 72 hours of toil, we had a working prototype. We were exhausted but also exhilarated. We recorded our demos and waited for the final results.
                To our surprise and delight, we were announced as one of the top three teams in the hackathon. We had won! Our hard work and dedication had paid off. The experience was life-changing, and I learned so much about teamwork and problem-solving.
                I am grateful for this hackathon experience, as it taught me valuable lessons and allowed me to showcase my skills. It was a defining moment in my career and I will always cherish it.</p>
