            <p>It was indeed a great experience to have been interviewed by the <b>Salesforce Team</b> at <b>BIT Mesra</b>, and finally being selected for 
			the internship program</p>
			
			<p>It was August 6, 2018, The process  began at 4.45 pm in the CAT hall where Salsesforce team presented the Pre Placement Talk which lasted uptil 5.15pm, 
			after that students were asked to move to their respective alloted labs and the entire process involved 4 rounds</p>
			<ul>
			<li><em><u><b>Initial Shortlisting</b></u></em></li>
			<p>This was the first round, which was a coding round, there were 2 questions, one was a dynamic programming problem and another was based on stack, implementation based , it also had some multiple choice questions on oop, dbms etc </p>
			<p>After Initial shortlisting, 15 boys and 2 girls were selected for subsequent rounds.</p>
			
			<li><em><u><b>Techincal Interview Round 1</b></u></em></li>
			
			<p>This round was conducted by them the same day, all selected candidates assemebled in the placement cell, and we waited in the seminar hall we were called for interview.
			</p>
			<p>we had been waiting there since 7.30 pm the same day and finally at 11.30 pm , I was called for the interview, the interview lasted for roughly 45 minutes and i was asked 
			2 algorithmic questions, which were good, but i was able to quickly come up with the solution,i had to write the code as well, i was further asked questions on OOP (as i had mentioned that in my resume),
			i was able to answer his questions , then he went on to ask pointers ( weak pointers and shared pointers etc) which i wasn't aware of.
			Finally the interviewer greeted me saying it was nice talking to me.
			after the round was over, it was 12.15 am , August 7, a placment coordinator informed me that i was shortlisted for next round and that i should be present the next morning at 9 am.
			</p>
			<p>6 boys out of all were selected for the next rounds and i was one among them.</p>
			
			<li><em><u><b>Techincal Interview Round 2</b></u></em></li>
			<p>The next day , i was present at the placement division at 9 am, i was called for interview at 11 am, it lasted roughly for an hour
			 and i was asked questions on trees, linkedlists, and data structures and i was asked to write 2 codes , one was a dynamic programming on trees and another was on disjoint set union.
			</p>
			<li><em><u><b>HR +Techincal Interview Round 3</b></u></em></li>
			<p>This round begun around 1 pm, i was initially asked to tell what i knew what they do and he further went on to tell that they wanted people who can learn really
			quickly, they are not just looking for competitive programmers.
			he further asked me to describe OOP concepts and then he asked Polymorphism and i was then asked "how runtime polymorphism is achieved internally",
			I was able to answer his questions, he went further to ask about the open source projects i had worked on, and had been scanning through my resume.
			he asked me how version control works and also tested if i was aware of chmod , grub config and few more linux oreinted concepts(as i mentioned Linux familiarity in my resume).
			I was able to answer most of the questions put to me.
			he then greeted me and wished me "all the best " for the declarations.
			This interview lasted for nearly 1 hour.
			
			</ul>

            <h2 class="centered"><b>Verdict -Selected</b></h2><hr/>
			<p> 3 out of 6 candidates were selected for the internship program and i was one of them,
			it was really a very different feeling, very calm and satisfying.
			then we were called in a conference room and were greeted by salesforce team,
			It was indeed a very amazing experience and i look forward to working consistently and effectively so as to achieve the goals i have set.
			</p>
			<h2 class="centered"><b>Token of Love and Motivation</b></h2><hr/>
			<p>I am extremely thankful to my family and friends who are a constant support and who guide me to do the right thing i should do.
			I believe that one has to be calm and composed and of course patience and hard is the only key which helps us pave our way to the threshold of
			success.
